# The Commons App

The Commons' mission is to build a platform to empower students with knowledge about their schools
by implementing a "group based" social platform. The application strives to emulate a campus common
area, where students can explore different communities founded in their schools.

The first step towards this vision is the implementation of a web-application which main objectives are:

1. Helping students find like-minded students and provides them with an easier way to contact them.
Not every student plans their college life the same way. Some may want to join the school football
team, some others may be thinking on joining the school band. Unlike most social networks, this platform is based upon a community search scope. Rather than following individuals, this platform ecourages their users to find groups they can learn and share content with.

2. Providing unexperienced students with precious knowledge about their schools.

3. Encouraging collaboration and student communication. (talk about )
